openSCAD files for creating a raspberry pi camera gimbal

These are the openSCAD files for my quickly hacked together raspberry pi gimbal. It uses two 9g servos and holds a raspberry pi camera. The software control for this device was provided by RPi Cam Web Interface (elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface). More info about the project is available on my blog at davecox.ca
